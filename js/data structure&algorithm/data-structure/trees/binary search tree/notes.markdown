# Trees

## Characteristic
* Lists are linear, but trees are nonlinear
* Roote- The top node ina tree.
* Child- A node directly connected to anotehr node when moving away from the root.
* Parent- The converse notion of a child
* Siblings- A group of nodes with the same parent.
* Leaf - A node with no children.
* Edge - The connection between one node and another.


## Application of tress
* HTML DOM
* Network routing
* Abstract syntax tree
* Artifical intelligence
* Folder operations
* Computer files system
* JSON 

## Kind of tree
* Trees
* Binary Trees- have most two children per node
* Binary Search Trees

## How BSTS Work
* Every parent node has at most two children.
* Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent.
* Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent.
#### It makes it very easy and fast to look things up.




## Big O of BST
* Insertion - O(log n)
* Searching - O(log n)
#### Double the number of nodes, it only increase the number of steps to insert/find by 1 (but not guaranteed!)
