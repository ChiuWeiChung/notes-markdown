# Treaversing a tree

## Two ways

* Breadth-first Search (BFS)
* Depth-first Search (DFS)

## Breadth-first Search (BFS);


## Depth-first Search (DFS)


## BFS and DFS, Which one is better?

* For Time Complexity, BFS and DFS are the same
* For Space Complexity, It depends on the structure of the tree. If it's a wide tree, BFS could store or take up a lot more space for the `queue array`, If it's a deep long tree, DFS could end up taking up more sapce.

## PreOrder, InOrder in DFS

* PreOrder: It can be useful if tring to clone or dulplicate a tree.
* InOrder: It can be useful for creating orderd data.
